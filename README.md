This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

🌟 Swipe App (Kotlin Multiplatform)
This is a modern, lightweight, and stylish Swipe App designed with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP).
The app lets you explore content by swiping through cards — much like popular dating or photo-browsing applications — and it's fully functional on both Android and iOS with a single codebase.

🚀 Features
Kotlin Multiplatform: Share common UI and business logic across Android and iOS.

Jetpack Compose: Built with Compose Multiplatform for a declarative UI, reducing redundancy.

Swipeable Cards: Smooth Tinder-like UI to navigate through content.

Scalable: Easily adaptable to different use cases — dating, photo gallery, products, and more.

Clean Codebase: Follows modern Android architecture patterns, making it easy to maintain and scale.
